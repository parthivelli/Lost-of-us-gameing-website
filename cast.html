With this new direction in his values, he looks to create a meaningful, rich life despite the bleak circumstances.<br><br>

Riley is fiercely independent and selfless, but the harsh realities of the world have also forced her to survive by any means possible. Although she is distrustful of new people, she is loving and outgoing around those she trusts, particularly Ellie, her best friend.</p>

Despite her experience supporting the rebellion, she remains gentle and compassionate. Her career in medicine cultivated her belief in the value of saving humanity – which she would pursue at any cost.</p>

                        <p class="content-tees">Tough, capable and arguably more cutthroat than her smuggling partner Joel, Tess overcame the struggles of the brutal world around her to become a savvy strategist and negotiator. Her leadership and physical prowess made her a respected figure in the Boston QZ. While she subscribed to the dog-eat-dog mentality of a hardened survivor, she remains loyal, courageous and ultimately proves to be selfless in her support of Joel and Ellie's journey.</p>

His practicality empowered him to fortify his domain against outside threats, whether human or Infected. His isolation has led to loneliness and paranoia – although he'd be the last person to admit that.</p>

Above all, he prioritises his role as the older brother and protector of Sam. Throughout the years, he and his brother are forced to grow and make tough decisions. They encounter their biggest challenge when their quarantine zone is abandoned, forcing them to search for a secure homestead.</p>

His older brother Henry's perpetual oversight and protection have resulted in Sam's fear that he will not survive in the future – and also catalyses him to help wherever he can. Despite the bleak state of the world, he still manages to express childlike joy, whether it's coveting a scavenged toy robot or finding moments to be playful.</p>

Therefore, Joel not only becomes her transporter – but a guide to the wider world. She is precocious, resourceful and capable. Whether it's sharing a good pun or overcoming a crisis, her wit and cleverness prove invaluable.<br>
                            5 years later, we reunite with Ellie in The Last of Us Part II. She has grown more confident, outspoken and strong. When a traumatic event rattles her and her community, she sets out to seek vengeance. Although she has matured, she must grapple with not only her Infected and human adversaries but also the emotional toll of her actions.</p>
