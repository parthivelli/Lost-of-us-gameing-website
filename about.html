                <h1>About the Story</h1>
                
                <p class="para">In 2013, an outbreak of a mutant Cordyceps fungus ravages the United States, transforming its human hosts into aggressive creatures. In the suburbs of Austin, Texas, Joel (Troy Baker) flees the chaos with his brother, Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce), and daughter, Sarah (Hana Hayes). As they flee, Sarah is shot by a soldier and dies in Joel's arms.<br><br>
                
                Twenty years later, civilization has been decimated by the infection. Joel works as a smuggler with his partner, Tess (Annie Wersching), in a quarantine zone in Boston, Massachusetts. They hunt down Robert (Robin Atkin Downes), a black-market dealer, to recover a stolen weapons cache he traded with the Fireflies, a rebel militia opposing the quarantine zone authorities. <br><br>
                Its leader Marlene (Merle Dandridge) promises to double their cache in return for smuggling a teenage girl, Ellie (Ashley Johnson), to Fireflies hiding in the Massachusetts State House. Joel and Tess discover Ellie is infected; she claims she is immune and may lead to a cure. At the State House, they discover the Fireflies have been killed and Tess reveals she has been infected. Believing in Ellie's importance, she sacrifices herself against pursuing soldiers so Joel and Ellie can escape. Joel decides to find Tommy, a former Firefly, in the hope that he can locate others.<br><br>
                
                In the spring, Joel and Ellie arrive in Salt Lake City. Ellie is rendered unconscious after almost drowning before they are captured by a Firefly patrol. In the hospital, Marlene tells Joel that Ellie is being prepared for surgery: in hopes of producing a vaccine for the infection, the Fireflies must remove the infected portion of Ellie's brain, which will kill her. Unwilling to let Ellie die, Joel battles his way to the operating room, and kills the lead surgeon.<br><br>

                Joel carries the unconscious Ellie to the parking garage, where he is confronted by Marlene, whom he shoots dead to prevent the Fireflies from pursuing them. On their way back to Tommy, when Ellie wakes up, Joel lies and tells her that the Fireflies had found other immune people but were unable to create a cure and have stopped trying. Ellie later expresses her survivor guilt. At her insistence, Joel swears his story about the Fireflies is true.</p>
